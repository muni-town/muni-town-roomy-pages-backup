Pages in Roomy
==============

We’ve now got support for pages in Roomy!

Pages are similar to wiki pages. By default they can be edited by anybody, and the entire edit history is preserved, so you can always see who changed what.

Rich Text Editor
----------------

Pages are markdown in the background, but we have a rich text editor so that it’s easy to edit.

Later we’ll add a markdown editor so that you can just edit that directly if you want to.

Formatting Demo
---------------

Your pages can have:

*   Headings
    
*   Quotes
    
*   Lists
    
*   [Links](https://example.com)
    

Image uploads will come soon.

And we also have quotes:

> The only thing to quote is quote itself.

Try pasting in a whole article from another website! The editor is pretty good at converting things.

### Automatic Git Backup

There is a service running that automatically backs up all of these pages to a [git repo](https://github.com/muni-town/muni-town-roomy-pages-backup), too!
